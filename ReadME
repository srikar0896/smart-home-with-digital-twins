# Smart Home with Digital Twins

## Overview

**Smart Home with Digital Twins** is a project that brings the power of digital twin technology to smart home automation. A digital twin is a virtual representation of real-world objects, systems, or environments. In this project, digital twins simulate the behavior and state of various smart devices and sensors in a home environment, allowing for advanced monitoring, control, and predictive maintenance.

## Features

- **Device Simulation:** Create digital twins for smart devices: thermostats, lights, appliances, etc.
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Visualize and track device status, sensor data, and home environment parameters.
- **Automation & Control:** Remotely control devices and automate routines using digital twins.
- **Predictive Insights:** Use simulated data to anticipate failures, optimize energy usage, and improve comfort.
- **Scalable Architecture:** Modular design for adding more devices and sensors.

## Technologies Used

- Programming languages: (fill in as appropriate, e.g., Python, JavaScript)
- IoT Integration: Connect real or simulated sensors and actuators.
- Visualization: Dashboard/web interface to monitor and control.
- Data Analysis: Predictive algorithms for maintenance and optimization.
